    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this very simple JavaEE application is to
        provide a extensible environment to analyze cell phone service
        company account statements to get a better overview of how
        exactly are the money and time spent.
    </p>
    <h3>Reason:</h3>
    <p>
        I personally find the native application developed by the company
        as very nice, although I'm missing some very interesting features
        such as per-phone-number analysis. Forutnatelly, it is possible
        to download a XLS sheet with the account statement data and
        therefore this is the open door to develop a new application to
        process this file and calculate all the interesting statistics.
